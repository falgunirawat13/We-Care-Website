                      The Road Safety initiative was a crucial aspect of our

                      month-long campaign by We Care to bring a change. From
                      conducting nukkad natakas and plays to demonstrate the
                      cruciality of human life, WeCare also organized rallies on
                      roads and drawing competitions in various schools to
                      address the need for road safety awareness. We Care
                      collaborated with multiple welfare organizations to echo
                      the lesson of road safety to a larger audience.

                      proper menstrual hygiene. By reaching out to these

                      access to the knowledge and resources necessary for
                      maintaining their health with dignity.
