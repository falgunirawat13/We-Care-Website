                gratitude on the impactful journey I shared with an organization

                lasting, positive mark on the lives of those we aimed to
                support.

                past three years, focusing on the education of underprivileged

                not only to the students' lives but also fostering my personal
                growth. 'We Care' has been a catalyst in shaping a better
                version of myself, providing immense satisfaction and purpose in
                my journey.

                In we care , i was assigned with the task of teaching the
                underprivileged children and to provide them with plethora of
                support so that they could achieve their dreams and become a
                better person. The ambiance that i experienced was not only
                giving me a sense of social work but also helped me in
                developing several skills as i went through events that are
                organised, focusing the children. We work as a team, train
                ourselves to guide the children to lead the right path in life.
