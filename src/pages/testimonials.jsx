                In we care , i was assigned with the task of teaching the
                underprivileged children and to provide them with plethora of
                support so that they could achieve their dreams and become a
                better person. The ambiance that i experienced was not only
                giving me a sense of social work but also helped me in
                developing several skills as i went through events that are
                organised, focusing the children. We work as a team, train
                ourselves to guide the children to lead the right path in life.
